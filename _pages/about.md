I am a first-year PhD student in Language Science at the University of California, Irvine, where I work with [Dr. Richard Futrell](http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/) on psychological and computational asepcts of sentence comprehension. Before joining UCI, I worked with [Dr. Allyson Ettinger](https://aetting.github.io/research.html) and [Dr. Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/) at the University of Chicago. My research build bridges between human brains and machines, addressing how human language is represented and processed in mind, and how it is different from machine language. I am concerned with 

* (i) interaction between syntactic and semantic processing in real-time language comprehension;
* (ii) the nature of meaning representation in brains and in machines;
* (iii) linguistic competence and interpretability of NLP models.

I use behavioral, electrophysiological methods (e.g. eye-tracking, self-paced reading, EEG), as well as computational modeling with state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g. GloVe, LSTM, transformers). 

I was born and raised in Taiyuan, a small town in northern China known for minerals. Besides, I speak Mandarin, Chinese Jin dialect, Cantonese, and Japanese. I am foodie of Cantonese cuisine and play games on Nintendo Switch and Steam.
